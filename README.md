# Lets Find Space

## About Application

Lets Find Space is a web application that allows users to create and join groups so that they can meet in a location that is most optimized and efficient in terms of physical distance between users in real life. The idea of this application is most suitable when we have an event that is hosted based on the demographics of its attendants.

This application operates on Node.js for backend integrated with MongoDB and React for frontend. It uses advanced Geocoding and place-finding based on a user's current location through various APIs offered by Google Maps Platform.

The optimized meeting location is calculated through the use of algebraic and geometric formulas and then returned back to Google's API which finds the most suitable meeting place based on users' preferences (Coffee Shops, Restaurants, etc..) 

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>.
